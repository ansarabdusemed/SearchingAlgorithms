Linear Search: search through the array (first parameter) from the beginning to the end, return the index of number (second parameter).
              Big(O): Best Case - O(1) Worst/Average Case - O(n)
              
Binary Search: rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time (ONLY WORKS ON SORTED ARRAYS, DIVIDE & CONQUER)
              Big(O): Best Case - O(1) Worst/Average Case - O(log n)
